**Project Description**
This is a simple ToDo list built in React.js. It allows adding, deleting and completing of Todo items.

**What I Learned**
1.  How to create a new React project
2.  The structure of a class component
3.  The structure of a functional component
4.  Creating styled components
5.  Using arrow functions to avoid having to use this.bind(this) for methods added to a component.
6.  "Climbing the Ladder" when using an event handler such as onClick in a child component in order to pass an attribute/property such as id up to the parent component where the actual onClick handler mehthod is defined. This is done so we are changing the state in the actual component where the state is stored.
